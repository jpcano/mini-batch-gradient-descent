# Mini Batch Gradient Descent (from scratch)

This project is based on the exercise 2.15 in the course "Introduction to Machine Learning with TensorFlow" from Udacity.

This notebook implements a mini batch gracien descent to creater a linear regression model for the example dataset. I added a mathematical explanation of the Python code as Latex markdown.
