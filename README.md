# Mini Batch Gradient Descent

This notebook provides a detailed implementation of Mini Batch Gradient Descent with traditional regression methods and compares it with linear and polynomial regression using scikit-learn. I added a mathematical explanation of the Python code that implements the GD from scratch.

This project is based on the exercise 2.15 in the course "Introduction to Machine Learning with TensorFlow" from Udacity.
